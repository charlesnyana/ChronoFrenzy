Loops
16. for loop, while loop
   ChronoFrenzy tab - line 101
17. A nested loop
   ChronoFrenzy tab - line 79-80
18. break
   zControls tab - line 14
19. What’s the difference between a for loop and a while loop?
  z
Functions
20. Declare & call a function with no parameters and no return type
21. Declare & call a function with a return type
22. What’s the difference between parameters and arguments?
23. Pass by copy (value): declare and use a function that takes int,
float, char, etc as an argument
24. Pass by reference (objects): declare and use a function that
takes an object as an argument
Classes/objects
25. What’s the difference between a class and an object?
26. What is a constructor function? What does it do and when?
27. Why should each class have its own tab in Processing?
28. Write a class with a constructor function
29. Use the keyword new to instantiate an object
30. Write a constructor function with parameters
Lists
31. What’s the difference between an array and an ArrayList?
32. Why would you want to go through a list backwards,
decrementing the index?
33. Initialize and populate an array
34. Initialize and populate an ArrayList
35. Manage a set of objects with an array or ArrayList
36. Use an ArrayList method: size(), get(), remove(), contains()
Vectors
37. When should you use PVector instead of float variables?
38. Use the PVector class
39. Do some basic physics: use position, velocity, and acceleration
(due to gravity) vectors
40. Find the direction and distance between two points
41. Create a random 2D vector
42. What is a normalized vector, why is it useful?
43. Using the Processing documentation look up a method in the
PVector class that’s new to you and use it in your code.
Nice to Know (optional)
44. Use a timer
45. Switch between “game states” (eg grounded/jumping) using
conditional statements
46. Make a button or toggle switch with a roll-over highlight (color
or size change)
47. Create a drag & drop object
48. Do animation with images (spritesheet or individual files)
49. Use collision detection between objects
50. Use the Game Control Plus controller library to get joystick or
gamepad input
